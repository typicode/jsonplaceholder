# JSONPlaceholder

[JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) is a simple fake REST API for testing and prototyping.

It's like an [image placeholder](http://placehold.it/) but for web developers.

JSONPlaceholder is powered by [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

## Why?

Most of the time when trying a new library, hacking a prototype or following a tutorial, I found myself in need of some data.

I didn't like the idea of using some public API because I had the feeling that I was spending more time registering a client and understanding a complex API than focusing on my task.

But I liked the idea of image placeholders for web designers. So I decided to code a little Express server inspired by that and here is JSONPlaceholder.

You can find it running here and are free to use it in your developments: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com. 

I hope you will find it useful.
